# Couchbase Node.js Client

The Node.js SDK library allows you to connect to a Couchbase cluster from
Node.js. It is a native Node.js module and uses the very fast libcouchbase
library to handle communicating to the cluster over the Couchbase binary
protocol.

## Installing

To install the lastest release using npm, run:

```bash
npm install couchbase
```

To install the development version directly from github, run:

```bash
npm install "git+https://github.com/couchbase/couchnode.git#master"
```

## Introduction

Connecting to a Couchbase bucket is as simple as creating a new `Cluster`
instance to represent the `Cluster` you are using, and then using the
`bucket` and `collection` commands against this to open a connection to
open your specific bucket and collection. You are able to execute most
operations immediately, and they will be queued until the connection is
successfully established.

Here is a simple example of instantiating a connection, adding a new document
into the bucket and then retrieving its contents:

```javascript
import { Cluster } from 'couchbase'

const cluster = await couchbase.connect(
  'couchbase://127.0.0.1',
  {
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password',
  })

await coll.upsert('testdoc', { name: 'Frank' })

const res = await coll.get('testdoc')
console.log(res.content)
```
