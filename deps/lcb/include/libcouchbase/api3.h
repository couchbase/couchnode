/**
 * @name Receiving Responses
 * @details
 * This section describes the structures used for receiving responses to
 * commands.
 *
 * Each command will have a callback invoked (typically once, for some commands
 * this may be more than once) with a response structure. The response structure
 * will be of a type that extends lcb_RESPBASE. The response structure should
 * not be modified and any of its fields should be considered to point to memory
 * which will be released after the callback exits.
 *
 * The common response header contains the lcb_RESPBASE::cookie field which
 * is the pointer to your application context (passed as the second argument
 * to the spooling function) and allows you to associate a specific command
 * with a specific response.
 *
 * The header will also contain the key (lcb_RESPBASE::key) field which can
 * also help identify the specific command. This is useful if you maintain a
 * single _cookie_ for multiple commands, and have per-item specific data
 * you wish to associate within the _cookie_ itself.
 *
 * Success or failure of the operation is signalled through the lcb_RESPBASE::rc
 * field. Note that even in the case of failure, the lcb_RESPBASE::cookie and
 * lcb_RESPBASE::key fields will _always_ be populated.
 *
 * Most commands also return the CAS of the item (as it exists on the server)
 * and this is placed inside the lcb_RESPBASE::cas field, however it is
 * only valid in the case where lcb_RESPBASE::rc is LCB_SUCCESS.
