/**
 * @ingroup lcb-cntl
 * @defgroup lcb-cntl-settings Setting List
 * @brief Adjust tunables for the client
 * @details
 *
 * The constants in this file are used to control the behavior of the library.
 * All of the operations above may be passed as the `cmd` parameter to the
 * lcb_cntl() function, thus:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * char something;
 * lcb_error_t rv;
 * rv = lcb_cntl(instance, LCB_CNTL_GET, LCB_CNTL_FOO, &something);
 * @endcode
 *
 * will retrieve the setting of `LCB_CNTL_FOO` into `something`.
 *
 * You may also use the lcb_cntl_string() function, which operates on
 * strings and can set various configuration properties fairly simply. Note
 * however that string names are subject to change, and not all configuration
 * directives have a string alias:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * rv = lcb_cntl_string("operation_timeout", "5.0");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Of the commands listed below, some will be read-only (i.e. you may only
 * _read_ the setting using the @ref LCB_CNTL_GET `mode`), some will be write-only
 * (i.e. you may only _modify_ the setting, and use @ref LCB_CNTL_SET for the `mode`)
 * and some will be both readable and writable.
 *
 * Along the documentation of each specific command, there is a table displaying
 * the modes supported and the expected pointer type to be passed as the `arg`
 * value into lcb_cntl(). Note that some read-write commands require different
 * pointer types depending on whether the `mode` is retrieval or storage.
 *
 *
 * @section lcb-timeout-info Timeout Settings
 *
 * Timeout settings control how long the library will wait for a certain event
 * before proceeding to the next course of action (which may either be to try
 * a different operation or fail the current one, depending on the specific
 * timeout).
 *
 * Timeouts are specified in _microseconds_ stored within an `lcb_U32`.
 *
 * Note that timeouts in libcouchbase are implemented via an event loop
 * scheduler. As such their accuracy and promptness is limited by how
 * often the event loop is invoked and how much wall time is spent in
 * each of their handlers. Specifically if you issue long running blocking
 * calls within any of the handlers (and this means any of the library's
 * callbacks) then the timeout accuracy will be impacted.
 *
 * Further behavior is dependent on the event loop plugin itself and how
 * it schedules timeouts.
 *
 *
 * @par Configuration Stability Attributes
 * Configuration parameters are still subject to the API classification used
 * in @ref lcb_attributes. For _deprecated_ control commands, lcb_cntl() will
 * either perform the operation, _or_ consider it a no-op, _or_ return an error
 * code.
