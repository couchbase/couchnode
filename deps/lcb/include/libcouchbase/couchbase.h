/**
 * @ingroup lcb-public-api
 * @defgroup lcb-init Initialization
 *
 * @details
 *
 * To communicate with a Couchbase cluster, a new library handle instance is
 * created in the form of an lcb_t. To create such an object, the lcb_create()
 * function is called, passing it a structure of type lcb_create_st. The structure
 * acts as a container for a union of other structures which are extended
 * as more features are added. This container is forwards and backwards
 * compatible, meaning that if the structure is extended, you code and application
 * will still function if using an older version of the structure. The current
 * sub-field of the lcb_create_st structure is the `v3` field.
 *
 * Connecting to the cluster involes the client knowing the necessary
 * information needed to actually locate its services and connect to it.
 *
 * A connection specification consists of:
 *
 * 1. One or more hosts which comprise the cluster
 * 2. The name of the bucket to access and perform operations on
 * 3. The credentials of the bucket
 *
 * All these options are specified within the form of a URI in the form of
 *
 * `couchbase://$HOSTS/$BUCKET?$OPTIONS`
 *
 * @note
 * If any of the fields (hosts, bucket, options) contain the `/` character then
 * it _must_ be url-encoded; thus a bucket named `foo/bar` would be specified
 * as `couchbase:///foo%2Fbar`
 *
 * @par Hosts
 *
 * In the most typical use case, you would specify a list of several hostnames
 * delimited by a comma (`,`); each host specified should be a member of the
 * cluster. The library will use this list to initially connect to the cluster.
 *
 * Note that it is not necessary to specify _all_ the nodes of the cluster as in
 * a normal situation the library will only initially connect to one of the nodes.
 * Passing multiple nodes increases the chance of a connection succeeding even
 * if some of the nodes are currently down. Once connected to the cluster, the
 * client will update itself with the other nodes actually found within the
 * cluster and discard the list passed to it
 *
 * You can specify multiple hosts like so:
 *
 * `couchbase://foo.com,bar.com,baz.com`
 *
 * Or a single host:
 *
 * `couchbase://localhost`
 *
 * #### Specifying Ports and Protocol Options
 *
 * The default `couchbase://` scheme will assume all hosts and/or ports
 * specify the _memcached_ port. If no port is specified, it is assumed
 * that the port is _11210). For more extended options there are additional
 * schemes available:
 *
 * * `couchbases://` - Will assume all ports refer to the SSL-enabled memcached
 *   ports. This setting implicitly enables SSL on the instance as well. If no
 *   ports are provided for the hosts, the implicit port for each host will be
 *   _11207_.
 *
 * * `http://` - Will assume all ports refer to the HTTP REST API ports used
 *   by Couchbase 2.2 and lower. These are also used when connecting to a
 *   memcached bucket. If no port is specified it will be assumed the port is
 *   _8091_.
 *
 * ### Bucket
 *
 * A bucket may be specified by using the optional _path_ component of the URI
 * For protected buckets a password will still need to be supplied out of band.
 *
 * * `couchbase://1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3/users` - Connect to the `users`
 *   bucket.
 *
 * ### Options
 *
 * @warning The key-value options here are considered to be a volatile interface
 * as their names may change.
 *
 * Options can be specified as the _query_ part of the connection string,
 * for example:
 *
 * `couchbase://cbnode.net/beer?operation_timeout=10000000`.
 *
 * Options may either be appropriate _key_ parameters for lcb_cntl_string()
 * or one of the following:
 *
 * * `boostrap_on` - specify bootstrap protocols. Values can be `http` to force
 *   old-style bootstrap mode for legacy clusters, `cccp` to force bootstrap
 *   over the memcached port (For clusters 2.5 and above), or `all` to try with
 *   _cccp_ and revert to _http_
 *
 * * `certpath` - Specify the path (on the local filesystem) to the server's
 *   SSL certificate. Only applicable if SSL is being used (i.e. the scheme is
 *   `couchbases`)
 *
 * ### Bucket Identification and Credentials
 *
 * The most common settings you will wish to modify are the bucket name
 *  and the credentials field (`user` and `passwd`). If a
 * `bucket` is not specified it will revert to the `default` bucket (i.e. the
 * bucket which is created when Couchbase Server is installed).
 *
 * The `user` and `passwd` fields authenticate for the bucket. This is only
 * needed if you have configured your bucket to employ SASL auth. You can tell
 * if the bucket has been configured with SASL auth by
 *
 * 1. Logging into the Couchbase Administration Console
 * 2. Going to the _Data Buckets_ tab
 * 3. Locate the row for your bucket
 * 4. Expand the row into the detailed view (by clicking on the arrow at the
 *    left of the row)
 * 5. Click on _Edit_
 * 6. Inspect the _Access Control_ section in the pop-up
 *
 * The bucket name is specified as the _path_ portion of the URI.
 *
 * For security purposes, the _user_ and _passwd_ cannot be specified within
 * the URI
 *
 *
 * @note
 * You may not change the bucket or credentials after initializing the handle.
 *
 * #### Bootstrap Options
 *
 * The default configuration process will attempt to bootstrap first from
 * the new memcached configuration protocol (CCCP) and if that fails, use
 * the "HTTP" protocol via the REST API.
 *
 * The CCCP configuration will by default attempt to connect to one of
 * the nodes specified on the port 11201. While normally the memcached port
 * is determined by the configuration itself, this is not possible when
 * the configuration has not been attained. You may specify a list of
 * alternate memcached servers by using the 'mchosts' field.
 *
 * If you wish to modify the default bootstrap protocol selection, you
 * can use the `bootstrap_on` option to specify the desired bootstrap
 * specification
 * to use for configuration (note that the ordering of this array is
 * ignored). Using this mechanism, you can disable CCCP or HTTP.
 *
 * To force only "new-style" bootstrap, you may use `bootstrap_on=cccp`.
 * To force only "old-style" bootstrap, use `bootstrap_on=http`. To force the
 * default behavior, use `bootstrap_on=all`

/**
 * @name Receiving Responses
 * @details
 *
 * This section describes the APIs used in receiving responses.
 *
 * Each command will have a callback invoked (typically once, for some commands
 * this may be more than once) with a response structure. The response structure
 * will be of a type that extends lcb_RESPBASE. The response structure should
 * not be modified and any of its fields should be considered to point to memory
 * which will be released after the callback exits.
 *
 * The common response header contains the lcb_RESPBASE::cookie field which
 * is the pointer to your application context (passed as the second argument
 * to the spooling function) and allows you to associate a specific command
 * with a specific response.
 *
 * The header will also contain the key (lcb_RESPBASE::key) field which can
 * also help identify the specific command. This is useful if you maintain a
 * single _cookie_ for multiple commands, and have per-item specific data
 * you wish to associate within the _cookie_ itself.
 *
 * Success or failure of the operation is signalled through the lcb_RESPBASE::rc
 * field. Note that even in the case of failure, the lcb_RESPBASE::cookie and
 * lcb_RESPBASE::key fields will _always_ be populated.
 *
 * Most commands also return the CAS of the item (as it exists on the server)
 * and this is placed inside the lcb_RESPBASE::cas field, however it is
 * only valid in the case where lcb_RESPBASE::rc is LCB_SUCCESS.

 *
 * The command is implemented by sending a series of `OBSERVE` broadcasts
 * (see lcb_observe3_ctxnew()) to all the nodes in the cluster which are either
 * master or replica for a specific key. It polls repeatedly
 * (see lcb_DURABILITYOPTSv0::interval) until all the items have been persisted and/or

 * (aee lcb_DURABILITYOPTsv0::timeout) has been reached.

 * lcb_MULTICMD_CTX::addcmd call).
 * @cb_err ::LCB_DUPLICATE_COMMANDS if using CAS-based durability and the

 *   `LCB_NO_MATCHING_SERVER` for the given item and will not request a new
 *   configuration. In this state, the client will not perform any network I/O
 *   until a request has been made to it using a key that is mapped to a known
 *   active node.
 *
 * * The library's heuristics may have failed to detect an error warranting
 *   a configuration change, but the application either through its own
 *   heuristics, or through an out-of-band channel knows that the configuration
 *   has changed.
 *
 *
 * This function is provided as an aid to assist in such situations
 *
 * If you wish for your application to block until a new configuration is
 * received, you _must_ call lcb_wait3() with the LCB_WAIT_NO_CHECK flag as
 * this function call is not bound to a specific operation. Additionally there
 * is no status notification as to whether this operation succeeded or failed
 * (the configuration callback via lcb_set_configuration_callback() may
 * provide hints as to whether a configuration was received or not, but by no
 * means should be considered to be part of this function's control flow).
 *
 * In general the use pattern of this function is like so:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * unsigned retries = 5;
 * lcb_error_t err;
 * do {
 *   retries--;
 *   err = lcb_get(instance, cookie, ncmds, cmds);

 *     usleep(100000);
 *     lcb_wait3(instance, LCB_WAIT_NO_CHECK);
 *   } else {
 *     break;
 *   }
 * } while (retries);
 * if (err == LCB_SUCCESS) {
 *   lcb_wait3(instance, 0); // equivalent to lcb_wait(instance);
 * } else {

 * @ingroup lcb-public-api
 * @defgroup lcb-sched Advanced Scheduling
 * @brief Additional functions for scheduling operations
 *
 * @details
 *
 * An application may spool multiple operations into the library with the
 * option of unspooling previously-spooled operations in case one of
 * the operations cannot be spooled. These semantics exist primarily to
 * support "all-or-nothing" scheduling found in the V2 API as well as in
 * some other wrapping SDKs.
 *
 * From version 2.4.0 to version 2.5.5, use of the explicit scheduling
 * API was mandatory to schedule operations. This API is optional since 2.5.6.
 *
 * The following operation APIs are low level entry points which create a
 * single operation. To use these operation APIs you should call the
 * lcb_sched_enter() which creates a virtual scope in which to create operations.
 *
 * For each of these operation APIs, the actual API call will insert the
 * created packet into a "Scheduling Queue" (this is done through
 * mcreq_sched_add() which is in mcreq.h). You may add as many items to this
 * scheduling queue as you would like.
 *
 * Note that an operation is only added to the queue if it was able to be
 * scheduled properly. If a scheduling failure occurred (for example, if a
 * configuration is missing, the command had invalid input, or memory allocation
 * failed) then the command will not be placed into the queue.
 *
 * Once all operations have been scheduled you can call
 * lcb_sched_leave() which will place all commands scheduled into the I/O
 * queue.
 *
 * If you wish to _discard_ all scheduled operations (for example, if one of
 * them errored, and your application cannot handle partial scheduling failures)
 * then you may call lcb_sched_fail() which will release all the resources
 * of the packets placed into the temporary queue.
 *
 * @par Behavior from version 2.5.6
 *
 * Starting from version 2.5.6, use of this API is optional. Scheduling functions
 * will now check if an empty call to lcb_sched_enter() is present. If no call
 * to lcb_sched_enter() is found then the library will implicitly call
 * lcb_sched_leave().
