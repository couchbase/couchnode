# Couchbase C Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/couchbase/libcouchbase.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/couchbase/libcouchbase)

This is the C client library for [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com)
It communicates with the cluster and speaks the relevant protocols
necessary to connect to the cluster and execute data operations.

## Features

* Can function as either a synchronous or asynchronous library
* Callback Oriented
* Can integrate with most other asynchronous environments. You can write your
  code to integrate it into your environment. Currently support exists for
    * [libuv](http://github.com/joyent/libuv) (Windows and POSIX)
    * [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) (POSIX)
    * [libevent](http://libevent.org/) (POSIX)
    * `select` (Windows and POSIX)
    * IOCP (Windows Only)
* Support for operation batching
* Cross Platform - Tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

## Building

Before you build from this repository, please check the
[installation page](http://developer.couchbase.com/server/other-products/release-notes-archives/c-sdk)
to see if there is a binary or release tarball available for your needs. Since the code here is
not part of an official release it has therefore not gone through our
release testing process.

### Dependencies

By default the library depends on:

* _libevent_ (or _libev_) for the primary I/O backend.
* _openssl_ for SSL transport.
* _CMake_ version 2.8.9 or greater (for building)

On Unix-like systems these dependencies are checked for by default
while on Windows they are not checked by default.

On Unix, the build system will expect to have _libevent_ or _libev_ installed,
unless building plugins is explicitly disabled (see further).

### Building on Unix-like systems

Provided is a convenience script called `cmake/configure`. It is a Perl
script and functions like a normal `autotools` script.

```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase.git
$ cd libcouchbase && mkdir build && cd build
$ ../cmake/configure
$ make
$ ctest
```

### Building on Windows

Assuming `git` and Visual Studio 2010 are installed, from a `CMD` shell, do:

```
C:\> git clone git://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase.git
C:\> mkdir lcb-build
C:\> cd lcb-build
C:\> cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..\libcouchbase
C:\> cmake --build .
```

This will generate and build a Visual Studio `.sln` file.

Windows builds are known to work on Visual Studio versions 2008, 2010 and
2012.

If you wish to link against OpenSSL, you should set the value of
`OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` to the location of the installation path, as described
[here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/FindOpenSSL.cmake)

## Bugs, Support, Issues

## Documentation

Documentation is available in guide format (introducing the basic concepts of
Couchbase and the library). It is recommended for first-time users, and can
be accessed at our [Documentation Site](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.5/sdk/c/start-using-sdk.html).

API documentation is also available and is generated from the library's headers.
It may contain references to more advanced features not found in the guide.

API documentation may be generated by running `doxygen` within the source root
directory. When this is done, you should have a `doc/html/index.html` page which
may be viewed.

Doxygen may be downloaded from the
[doxygen downloads page](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html). Note
however that most Linux distributions as well as Homebrew contain Doxygen in their
repositories.

```
$ doxygen
$ xdg-open doc/html/index.html # Linux
$ open doc/html/index.html # OS X
```

You may also generate documentation using the `doc/Makefile` which dynamically
inserts version information

```
$ make -f doc/Makefile public # for public documentation
$ make -f doc/Makefile internal # for internal documentation
```

The generated documentation will be in the `doc/public/html` directory for
public documentation, and in the `doc/internal/html` directory for internal
documentation.
