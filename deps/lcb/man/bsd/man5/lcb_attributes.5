.SH "NAME"
lcb_attributes \- attributes of interfaces
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The attribute section of the manual pages for libcouchbase contains a table defining the attribute types and their coresponding values\&.
.SH "INTERFACE STABILITY"
.sp
Libcouchbase tries to follow the "release early, release often" philosophy\&. As part of that we want people to be able to try out new interfaces before we "stick" to them\&. Unfortunately this means that we discover that we need to change them in incompatible ways\&.
.sp
To aid developers to make reasonable decisions on how likely we are to change these interfaces all functions in libcouchbase have an associated Interface Stability tag\&. If you find undocumented structs, functions or files you should \fBnot\fR use them\&. They may be changed in incompatible ways without any notice\&. Unless explicitly noted the interface stability applies to both source code and binaries\&.
.sp
Libcouchbase use the version numbering as outlined in http://semver\&.org/
.sp
The following classifications exists:
.SS "Committed"
.sp
A committed interface is the highest grade of stability, and is the preferred attribute level for consumers of the library\&. Couchbase tries at best effort to preseve committed interfaces between major versions of libcouchbase, and changes to committed interfaces within a major version is highly exceptional\&. Such exceptions may include situations where the interface may lead to data corruption, security holes etc\&.
.SS "Uncommitted interface"
.sp
No commitment is made about the interface (in binary or source form)\&. It may be changed in incompatible ways and dropped from one release to another\&. The difference between an uncommitted interface and a volatile interface is its maturity and likelyhood of being changed\&.
.SS "Volatile interfaces"
.sp
Volatile interfaces can change at any time and for any reason\&. The purpose of a volatile interface is to allow external entities to provide feedback on new interfaces\&.
.SS "Deprecated"
.sp
The interface is subject to be removed from future versions of libcouchbase\&.
.SS "Private"
.sp
Private interfaces is used internally in libcouchbase and should not be used elsewhere\&. Doing so may cause libcouchbase to misbehave\&.
.SH "MT-LEVEL"
.sp
In order to allow libcouchbase to scale out it does not use any locks internally (unless those provided by system calls)\&. Marking the entire library as unsafe would not help developers, and refactoring all methods to contain an _r suffix seems more annoying than helpful\&. Instead libcouchbase "tweaks" the definitions of MT\-Level classifications:
.SS "MT\-Safe"
.sp
An MT\-safe operation in libcouchbase means that it is reentrant\&. It is MT\-safe as long as only one thread operates on the same lcb_t at the same time (please note that this is no longer true if you use the same lcb_io_opt_t from multiple threads, or a custom non\-mt\-safe lcb_io_opt_t is used)\&.
.sp
If the same lcb_t is to be used from multiple threads (or the lcb_io_opt_t use global resources), locking \fImust\fR be performed by the caller:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mutex_lock( /* \&.\&.\&. */ );
lcb_get(instance, cookie, 1, commands);
mutex_unlock( /* \&.\&.\&. */ );
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
It is however safe (given that the lcb_io_opt_t in use is MT\-safe) to use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
thread 1:
lcb_get(thread1_instance, cookie, 1, commands));
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
thread 2:
lcb_get(thread2_instance, cookie, 1, commands));
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Unsafe"
.sp
An operation is considered unsafe if it operates on global data that is unprotected\&. Lib
